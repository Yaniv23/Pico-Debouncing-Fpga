# PicoBlaze Debouncing LED Controller (FPGA - VHDL + PSM)

This FPGA project implements a digital switch debouncing circuit in VHDL and uses a PicoBlaze soft processor to toggle an LED with a programmable delay. It includes simulation files, waveform configuration, and assembly firmware for the processor.

---

## üß† Features

- Switch debouncing implemented in VHDL
- PicoBlaze soft processor (KCPSM) controls LED toggling
- LED blinking delay based on a cubic loop: `N¬≥ √ó 40ns`
- Assembly firmware written in `.psm` (KCPSM3 syntax)
- Testbench and waveform configuration included for simulation

## üõ† Requirements

- **Xilinx Vivado 2020.2+**
- **KCPSM3 Assembler** (for `.psm` firmware)
- **Basys 3 FPGA board** (or compatible)
- UART terminal (optional)

## üöÄ How to Use

### üß™ Simulate

1. Open Vivado and launch the project (`Lab_7_Debouncing.xpr`)
2. Run simulation with `main_tb.vhd`
3. Load waveform configuration: `main_tb_behav.wcfg`
4. Observe switch behavior and debouncing waveform

### üíª Deploy to Hardware

1. Assemble the `Lab7_vhdl_pico.psm` using KCPSM3
2. Load the compiled firmware into BRAM or memory block
3. Generate and program bitstream to the Basys 3 board
4. Press switch to toggle LED with debounced logic
